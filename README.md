# Boosting the transferability of adversarial attacks with EOT
This work applies an existed white-box attack method called Expectation over Transformation (EOT) in transfer attacks. The key idea is to
introduce a distribution of transformation to the objective function of the surrogate model. A detailed theoretical analysis about the feasibility
of the project is provided. Besides, in our experiments, the EOT method is combined with other black-box attack algorithms to achieve better transferability improvements.  

For more detailed information, please look through the project report and codes.
